- [x] **Problem 5. Smallest multiple.** 
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

- [x] **Problem 6. Sum square difference.** 
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

- [x] **Problem 12. Highly divisible triangular number.**
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:<br>
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...<br>
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:<br>
 1: 1<br>
 3: 1,3<br>
 6: 1,2,3,6<br>
10: 1,2,5,10<br>
15: 1,3,5,15<br>
21: 1,3,7,21<br>
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28<br>
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

- [x] **Problem 13. Large sum.**
Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers (see problem_13.input).

- [x] **Problem 14. Longest Collatz sequence.**
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:<br>
n → n/2 (n is even)<br>
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)<br>
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:<br>
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1<br>
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

- [x] **Problem 15. Lattice paths.**

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

- [x] **Problem 16. Power digit sum.**
2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?

- [x] **Problem 17. Number letter counts.**
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

- [x] **Problem 18. Maximum path sum I.**
 By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below,
 the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
    3
   7 4
  2 4 6
 8 5 9 3
 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
 Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:
 ```
                                 75
                               95 64
                             17 47 82
                           18 35 87 10
                         20 04 82 47 65
                       19 01 23 75 03 34
                     88 02 77 73 07 63 67
                   99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92
                 41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33
               41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29
             53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14
           70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57
         91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48
       63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31
     04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23
```
 NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route.
 However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows;
 it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

- [x] **Problem 19. Counting Sundays.**
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
```
    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
    Thirty days has September,
    April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Saving February alone,
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
```
 A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
 
- [x] **Problem 20. Factorial digit sum.**
<br>n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

- [x] **Problem 21. Amicable numbers.**
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
