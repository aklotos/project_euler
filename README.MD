- [x] **Problem 5. Smallest multiple.** 
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

- [x] **Problem 6. Sum square difference.** 
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

- [x] **Problem 12. Highly divisible triangular number.**
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:<br>
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...<br>
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:<br>
 1: 1<br>
 3: 1,3<br>
 6: 1,2,3,6<br>
10: 1,2,5,10<br>
15: 1,3,5,15<br>
21: 1,3,7,21<br>
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28<br>
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

- [x] **Problem 13. Large sum.**

- [x] **Problem 14. Longest Collatz sequence.**
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:<br>
n → n/2 (n is even)<br>
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)<br>
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:<br>
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1<br>
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
